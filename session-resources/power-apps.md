# Create great apps without the CS degree using Power Apps!

Power Apps empowers everyday people without a Computer Science degree to solve problems by building lightweight apps for the web and phone. If you can use Excel, you can build Power Apps! In this session, we'll step through a simple "Research Buddy" app that explores the problem of collecting and tagging information resources, as you might when studying for a project or onboarding for a new role. Attendees will get an overview of Power Apps creation basics, where to find resources to get started, and inspiration to start building apps of their own!
